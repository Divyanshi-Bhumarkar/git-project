after installing git you have to these things
-->check version
	git --version

-->set config values
	git config --global user.name "Divyanshi"
	git config --global user.email "@gmail.com
	
	git config --list (to check those values)

-->need help
	git help <verb> (here the first verb we have used is config in those command , 	to know what does that verb do or meaning of it. If we put config in place of 	<verb> a manual will open which will give info about config verb.)
	git <verb> --help

-->initialize a repository from existing code
	git init (it will create a repository in your device)
